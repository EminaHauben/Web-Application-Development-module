//I have chosen to implement code to calculate mortgage payment. To ensure the formula is clear, I will give the variables short names, and explain them in the adjacent comment.

const P= 85000 //The principal, this is the amount of money you borrowed.
const r= (5/100)/12 //The monthly interest rate
const n= 30*12 //the number of payments. We take 30 years, and multiply this by 12 to get the monthly payment, thus the number of payments

let M; //we will now calculate M. M stands for the amount of money you need to pay per month

//To make sure the mathematical calculations go correctly, I will 

M= P*((r*(1+r)^n)/(((1+r)^n)-1))
console.log (M)
